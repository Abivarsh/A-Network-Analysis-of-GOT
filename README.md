# A-Network-Analysis-of-GOT
In this project, I am working on the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire (perhaps better known as the TV show Game of Thrones). I will analyze how the importance of the characters changes over the books using different centrality measures.

This project requires familiarity with the networkx package and different network centrality measures. Manipulation of dataframes are done using Pandas.
